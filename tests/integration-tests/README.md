# ArDoCo Integration Tests

The goal of this project is to connect architecture documentation and models with Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) while identifying missing or deviating
elements (inconsistencies).
An element can be any representable item of the model, like a component or a relation.
To do so, we first create trace links and then make use of them and other information to identify inconsistencies.

ArDoCo is actively developed by researchers of
the _[Modelling for Continuous Software Engineering (MCSE) group](https://mcse.kastel.kit.edu)_
of _[KASTEL - Institute of Information Security and Dependability](https://kastel.kit.edu)_ at
the [KIT](https://www.kit.edu).
