In a first step, you shall elaborate on the following documentation:\n\nArchitecture contains UI Component, Logic Component, Storage Component, Common Component, Test Driver Component, E2E Component, Client Component.\nTEAMMATES is a Web application that runs on Google App Engine (GAE).\nGiven above is an overview of the main components.\nThe UI Browser seen by users consists of Web pages containing HTML, CSS for styling and JavaScript for client-side interactions such as sorting, input validation, etc..\nThis UI is a single HTML page generated by Angular framework.\nThe initial page request is sent to the server over HTTP, and requests for data are sent asynchronously with AJAX.\nIn the UI Server the entry point for the application back end logic is designed as a REST-ful controller.\nThe main logic of the application is in POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).\nThe storage layer of the application uses the persistence framework provided by GAE Datastore, a NoSQL database.\nThe following explains the use of the Test Driver.\nTEAMMATES makes heavy use of automated regression testing.\nTest data is transmitted using JSON format.\nTestNG is used for Java testing (all levels) and Jest for JavaScript unit-testing.\nHttpUnit is used to set up a simulated web server in servlet-level tests, where an actual web server is not required.\nThe E2E end-to-end component is used to interact with the application as a whole with Web browsers.\nIts primary function is for E2E tests.\nSelenium Java is used to automate E2E testing with actual Web browsers.\nThe Client component can connect to the back end directly without using a Web browser.\nIt is used for administrative purposes, e.g. migrating data to a new schema.\nThe Common component contains utility code (data transfer objects, helper classes, etc.) used across the application.\nThe diagram below shows how the code in each component is organized into packages and the dependencies between them.\nlogic, ui.website, ui.controller represent an application of Model-View-Controller pattern.\nui.website is not a real package.\nIt is a conceptual package representing the front-end of the application.\nThe diagram below shows the object structure of the UI component.\nui.website is not a Java package.\nIt is written in Angular framework and consists of HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript files.\nThe framework will build those files into HTML, CSS and JavaScript files ready to be used by standard Web browsers.\nThe UI component is the first stop for 99% of all requests that are received by the application.\nSuch a request will go through the following steps.\nFirst, request received by the GAE server.\nSecond, custom filters are applied according to the order specified in web.xml, e.g. OriginCheckFilter.\nThird, request forwarded to a Servlet object as specified in web.xml for further processing, depending on the type of request.\nThere are two general types of requests.\nThe user-invoked requests and the automated (GAE server-invoked) requests, which are processed differently.\nUser-invoked requests are all requests made by the users of the application, typically from the Web browser (i.e. by navigating to a particular URL of the application).\nThe request will be processed as in the image.\nThe initial request for the web page will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to WebPageServlet.\nSecond, WebPageServlet returns the built single web page (index.html).\nThird, the browser will render the page and execute the page scripts, most of the time requiring AJAX requests to the server.\nSubsequent AJAX requests sent to the server will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to the WebApiServlet.\nSecond, WebApiServlet uses the ActionFactory to generate the matching Action object, e.g. InstructorHomePageAction.\nThird, WebApiServlet executes the action.\nFourth, the Action object checks the access rights of the user.\nIf the action is allowed, it will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nFifth, the Action packages and processes the result into an ActionResult object.\nThe most common format is JsonResult (requests for obtaining data or processing existing data), and other formats are defined as necessary, e.g. FileDownloadResult (e.g. downloading feedback session report) and ImageResult (e.g. profile pictures).\nSixth, WebApiServlet sends the result back to the browser which will then process it on the front-end.\nRequests for static asset files (e.g. CSS, JS files, images) are served directly without going through web.xml configuration at all.\nThe Web API is protected by two layers of access control check.\nThese are origin check, authentication and authorization check.\nOrigin check mitigates CSRF attack.\nAuthentication and authorization check checks if the logged in user (or lack thereof) has sufficient privileges to trigger the API's actions.\nSpecial keys (csrf key and backdoor key) can be used to bypass each of the checks, typically for testing purpose.\nThose keys are strings known only to the person who deployed the application (typically, the administrator).\nAutomated requests are all requests sent automatically by the GAE server during specific periods of time.\nThis type of request will be processed as follows.\nFirst, the source of the request will be checked for administrator privilege.\nIf this privilege is absent (e.g. non-administrator users trying to invoke the automated actions), the request will be dropped and a 403 Forbidden status will be returned.\nSecond, requests generated by the GAE server are equipped with this privilege.\nThird, administrators can manually invoke these requests.\nThis is particularly useful in testing the actions associated with those requests.\nFourth, request forwarded to the AutomatedServlet.\nFifth, automatedServlet uses the AutomatedActionFactory to generate the matching AutomatedAction object, e.g. CompileLogsAction.\nSixth, automatedServlet executes the action.\nSeventh, the corresponding AutomatedAction will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nGAE server sends such automated requests through two different configurations.\nThese configurations are cron jobs or task queue workers.\nCron jobs are jobs that are automatically scheduled for a specified period of time, e.g. scheduling feedback session opening reminders.\nIt is configured in cron.xml.\nTask queue workers are hybrids of user-invoked and GAE-invoked in that they are queued by users (i.e. users request for the tasks to be added to queue), but executed by GAE (i.e. GAE determines when and which tasks in the queue are executed at any point of time).\nThis is typically used for tasks that may take a long time to finish and can exceed the 1 minute standard request processing limit imposed by GAE.\nIt is configured in queue.xml as well as the TaskQueue nested class of the Const class.\nSince the high-level workflow of processing a request is same for any request (differing by the two request types only), we use the Template Method pattern to abstract the process flow into the Action and AutomatedAction classes.\nThe Logic component handles the business logic of TEAMMATES.\nIn particular, it is responsible for the following.\nManaging relationships between entities, e.g. cascade logic for create/update/delete.\nManaging transactions, e.g. ensuring atomicity of a transaction.\nSanitizing input values received from the UI component.\nProviding a mechanism for checking access control rights.\nConnecting to GAE-provided or third-party APIs, e.g. for adding tasks to the task queue and for sending emails with third-party providers.\nPackage overview contains logic.api, logic.core.\nlogic.api provides the API of the component to be accessed by the UI.\nlogic.core contains the core logic of the system.\nLogic API is represented by the classes Logic, GateKeeper, EmailGenerator, EmailSender, TaskQueuer.\nLogic is a Facade class which connects to the several Logic classes to handle the logic related to various types of data and to access data from the Storage component.\nGateKeeper checks access rights of a user for a given action.\nEmailGenerator generates emails to be sent.\nEmailSender sends email with the provider chosen based on the build configuration.\nIt connects to the email provider by using the appropriate Service class.\nTaskQueuer adds tasks to the task queue.\nIt connects to GAE's task queue API.\nTo access control the following information are presented.\nAlthough this component provides methods to perform access control, the API itself is not access controlled.\nThe UI is expected to check access control (using GateKeeper class) before calling a method in the Logic.\nTo API for creating entities the following information are presented.\nNull parameters causes an assertion failure.\nInvalid parameters throws InvalidParametersException.\nEntity already exists throws EntityAlreadyExistsException (escalated from Storage level).\nTo API for retrieving entities the following information are presented.\nAttempting to retrieve objects using null parameters causes an assertion failure.\nEntity not found returns null if the target entity not found.\nThis way, read operations can be used easily for checking the existence of an entity.\nTo API for updating entities the following information are presented.\nUpdate is done using UpdateOptions inside every Attributes.\nThe UpdateOptions will specify what is used to identify the entity to update and what will be updated.\nEntity not found throws EntityDoesNotExistException.\nInvalid parameters throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for deleting entities the following information are presented.\nThe following explains the FailDeleteSilentlyPolicy.\nIn general, delete operation do not throw exceptions if the target entity does not exist.\nThis is because if it does not exist, it is as good as deleted.\nThe following explains the Cascade policy.\nWhen a parent entity is deleted, entities that have referential integrity with the deleted entity should also be deleted.\nRefer to the API for the cascade logic.\nThe Storage component performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data entities individually.\nIt contains minimal logic beyond what is directly relevant to CRUD operations.\nIn particular, it is reponsible for the following.\nValidating data inside entities before creating/updating them, to ensure they are in a valid state.\nHiding the complexities of datastore from the Logic component.\nAll GQL queries are to be contained inside the Storage component.\nHiding the persistable objects.\nClasses in the storage.entity package are not visible outside this component to hide information specific to data persistence.\nInstead, a corresponding non-persistent data transfer object named Attributes (e.g., CourseAttributes is the data transfer object for Course entities) object is returned.\nThese datatransfer classes are in common.datatransfer package, to be explained later.\nThe Storage component does not perform any cascade delete/create operations.\nCascade logic is handled by the Logic component.\nPackage overview contains storage.api, storage.entity, storage.search.\nstorage.api provides the API of the component to be accessed by the logic component.\nstorage.entity contains classes that represent persistable entities.\nstorage.search contains classes for dealing with searching and indexing.\nNote that the navigability of the association links between entity objects appear to be in the reverse direction of what we see in a normal OOP design.\nThis is because we want to keep the data schema flexible so that new entity types can be added later with minimal modifications to existing elements.\nRepresented by the Db classes.\nThese classes act as the bridge to the GAE Datastore.\nAdd and Delete operations try to wait until data is persisted in the datastore before returning.\nThis is not enough to compensate for eventual consistency involving multiple servers in the GAE production environment.\nHowever, it is expected to avoid test failures caused by eventual consistency in dev server and reduce such problems in the live server.\nEventual consistency here means it takes some time for a database operation to propagate across all serves of the Google's distributed datastore.\nAs a result, the data may be in an inconsistent states for short periods of time although things should become consistent eventually.\nFor example, an object we deleted may appear to still exist for a short while.\nImplementation of Transaction Control has been minimized due to limitations of GAE environment and the nature of our data schema.\nTo API for creating the following information are presented.\nAttempt to create an entity that already exists throws EntityAlreadyExistsException.\nAttempt to create an entity with invalid data throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for retrieving the following information are presented.\nAttempt to retrieve an entity that does not exist returns null.\nTo API for updating the following information are presented.\nAttempt to update an entity that does not exist throws EntityDoesNotExistException.\nAttempt to update an entity with invalid data throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for deleting the following information are presented.\nAttempt to delete an entity that does not exist fails silently.\nThe Common component contains common utilities used across TEAMMATES.\nPackage overview contains common.util, common.exceptions, common.datatransfer.\ncommon.util contains utility classes.\ncommon.exceptions contains custom exceptions.\ncommon.datatransfer contains data transfer objects.\ncommon.datatransfer package contains lightweight data transfer object classes for transferring data among components.\nThey can be combined in various ways to transfer structured data between components.\nGiven below are three examples.\nTest Driver can use the DataBundle in this manner to send an arbitrary number of objects to be persisted in the database.\nThis structure can be used to transfer data of a course (e.g., when constructing the home page for an instructor).\nThis structure can be used to send results of a feedback session (e.g., when showing a feedback session report to an instructor).\nSome of these classes are methodless and thus more of a data structure rather than a class.\nThese classes use public variables for data for easy access.\nThis component automates the testing of TEAMMATES.\nPackage overview contains test.driver, test.cases and subpackages.\ntest.driver contains infrastructure and helpers needed for running the tests.\ntest.cases contains test cases.\nSub-packages contains x.testdriver, x.datatransfer, x.util, x.logic, x.storage, x.search, x.webapi, x.automated.\nx.testdriver contains component test cases for testing the test driver infrastructure and helpers.\nx.datatransfer contains component test cases for testing the datatransfer objects from the Common component.\nx.util contains component test cases for testing the utility classes from the Common component.\nx.logic contains component test cases for testing the Logic component.\nx.storage contains component test cases for testing the Storage component.\nx.search contains component test cases for testing the search functions.\nx.webapi contains system test cases for testing the user-invoked actions.\nx.automated contains system test cases for testing the system-automated actions (manually invoked during testing).\nSome Component tests are pure unit tests (i.e. testing one component in isolation) while others are integration tests that test units as well as integration of units with each other.\nFront-end files (particularly TypeScript) are tested separately with Jest.\nThe test cases are found in x.spec.ts files.\nThis is how TEAMMATES testing maps to standard types of testing.\nThe E2E component has no knowledge of the internal workings of the application and can only interact either with Web browser as a whole application or REST API calls for the back-end logic.\nIts primary function is for E2E tests and L&P (Load & Performance) tests.\nPackage overview contains e2e.util, e2e.pageobjects, e2e.cases, x.util, x.e2e, x.lnp.\ne2e.util contains helpers needed for running E2E tests.\ne2e.pageobjects contains abstractions of the pages as they appear on a Browser (i.e. SUTs).\ne2e.cases contains test cases.\nx.util contains component test cases for testing the test helpers.\nx.e2e contains system test cases for testing the application as a whole.\nx.lnp contains load and performance tests (experimental).\nThe Client component contains scripts that can connect directly to the application back-end for administrative purposes, such as migrating data to a new schema and calculating statistics.\nPackage overview contains client.util, client.remoteapi, client.scripts.\nclient.util contains helpers needed for client scripts.\nclient.remoteapi classes needed to connect to the back end directly.\nclient.scripts scripts that deal with the back end data for administrative purposes.\n\" }] }]":"The TEAMMATES application is composed of several components, each with its own specific responsibilities and testing requirements. The following is a detailed overview of each component and their respective test cases:\n\n1. Common Component: This component contains common utilities used across TEAMMATES, such as data transfer objects, custom exceptions, and utility classes. Test cases for this component include unit tests for the data transfer objects, integration tests for the utility classes, and system tests for the custom exceptions.\n2. Logic Component: This component is responsible for handling business logic and validating user input. Test cases for this component include unit tests for the validation methods, integration tests for the business logic, and system tests for the overall functionality of the component.\n3. Storage Component: This component is responsible for storing and retrieving data from a database. Test cases for this component include unit tests for the database interactions, integration tests for the storage and retrieval of data, and system tests for the overall functionality of the component.\n4. Search Component: This component is responsible for searching through data in the database. Test cases for this component include unit tests for the search algorithms, integration tests for the search functionality, and system tests for the overall functionality of the component.\n5. Web API Component: This component is responsible for handling user-invoked actions and returning responses to the client. Test cases for this component include unit tests for the REST API endpoints, integration tests for the request and response processing, and system tests for the overall functionality of the component.\n6. E2E Component: This component is responsible for testing the application as a whole, including both functional and performance testing.

Test cases for this component include unit tests for the client scripts, integration tests for the database interactions, and system tests for the overall functionality of the component.\n\nIn summary, TEAMMATES has a modular architecture with each component having its own specific responsibilities and testing requirements. The testing strategy is to follow a TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach, where unit tests are written first and then the implementation is developed to make the tests pass. Integration tests are used to ensure that different components work together correctly, while system tests are used to test the overall functionality of the application.","[UserMessage { name = null contents = [TextContent { text = \"Your task is to identify the high-level components based on a software architecture documentation.

ui.website, ui.controller represent an application of Model-View-Controller pattern.\nui.website is not a real package.\nIt is a conceptual package representing the front-end of the application.\nThe diagram below shows the object structure of the UI component.\nui.website is not a Java package.\nIt is written in Angular framework and consists of HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript files.\nThe framework will build those files into HTML, CSS and JavaScript files ready to be used by standard Web browsers.\nThe UI component is the first stop for 99% of all requests that are received by the application.\nSuch a request will go through the following steps.\nFirst, request received by the GAE server.\nSecond, custom filters are applied according to the order specified in web.xml, e.g. OriginCheckFilter.\nThird, request forwarded to a Servlet object as specified in web.xml for further processing, depending on the type of request.\nThere are two general types of requests.\nThe user-invoked requests and the automated (GAE server-invoked) requests, which are processed differently.\nUser-invoked requests are all requests made by the users of the application, typically from the Web browser (i.e. by navigating to a particular URL of the application).\nThe request will be processed as in the image.\nThe initial request for the web page will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to WebPageServlet.\nSecond, WebPageServlet returns the built single web page (index.html).\nThird, the browser will render the page and execute the page scripts, most of the time requiring AJAX requests to the server.\nSubsequent AJAX requests sent to the server will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to the WebApiServlet.\nSecond, WebApiServlet uses the ActionFactory to generate the matching Action object, e.g. InstructorHomePageAction.\nThird, WebApiServlet executes the action.\nFourth, the Action object checks the access rights of the user.\nIf the action is allowed, it will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nFifth, the Action packages and processes the result into an ActionResult object.\nThe most common format is JsonResult (requests for obtaining data or processing existing data), and other formats are defined as necessary, e.g. FileDownloadResult (e.g. downloading feedback session report) and ImageResult (e.g. profile pictures).\nSixth, WebApiServlet sends the result back to the browser which will then process it on the front-end.\nRequests for static asset files (e.g. CSS, JS files, images) are served directly without going through web.xml configuration at all.\nThe Web API is protected by two layers of access control check.\nThese are origin check, authentication and authorization check.\nOrigin check mitigates CSRF attack.\nAuthentication and authorization check checks if the logged in user (or lack thereof) has sufficient privileges to trigger the API's actions.\nSpecial keys (csrf key and backdoor key) can be used to bypass each of the checks, typically for testing purpose.\nThose keys are strings known only to the person who deployed the application (typically, the administrator).\nAutomated requests are all requests sent automatically by the GAE server during specific periods of time.\nThis type of request will be processed as follows.\nFirst, the source of the request will be checked for administrator privilege.\nIf this privilege is absent (e.g. non-administrator users trying to invoke the automated actions), the request will be dropped and a 403 Forbidden status will be returned.\nSecond, requests generated by the GAE server are equipped with this privilege.\nThird, administrators can manually invoke these requests.\nThis is particularly useful in testing the actions associated with those requests.\nFourth, request forwarded to the AutomatedServlet.\nFifth, automatedServlet uses the AutomatedActionFactory to generate the matching AutomatedAction object, e.g. CompileLogsAction.\nSixth, automatedServlet executes the action.\nSeventh, the corresponding AutomatedAction will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nGAE server sends such automated requests through two different configurations.\nThese configurations are cron jobs or task queue workers.\nCron jobs are jobs that are automatically scheduled for a specified period of time, e.g. scheduling feedback session opening reminders.\nIt is configured in cron.xml.\nTask queue workers are hybrids of user-invoked and GAE-invoked in that they are queued by users (i.e. users request for the tasks to be added to queue), but executed by GAE (i.e. GAE determines when and which tasks in the queue are executed at any point of time).\nThis is typically used for tasks that may take a long time to finish and can exceed the 1 minute standard request processing limit imposed by GAE.\nIt is configured in queue.xml as well as the TaskQueue nested class of the Const class.\nSince the high-level workflow of processing a request is same for any request (differing by the two request types only), we use the Template Method pattern to abstract the process flow into the Action and AutomatedAction classes.\nThe Logic component handles the business logic of TEAMMATES.\nIn particular, it is responsible for the following.\nManaging relationships between entities, e.g. cascade logic for create/update/delete.\nManaging transactions, e.g. ensuring atomicity of a transaction.\nSanitizing input values received from the UI component.\nProviding a mechanism for checking access control rights.\nConnecting to GAE-provided or third-party APIs, e.g. for adding tasks to the task queue and for sending emails with third-party providers.\nPackage overview contains logic.api, logic.core.\nlogic.api provides the API of the component to be accessed by the UI.\nlogic.core contains the core logic of the system.\nLogic API is represented by the classes Logic, GateKeeper, EmailGenerator, EmailSender, TaskQueuer.\nLogic is a Facade class which connects to the several Logic classes to handle the logic related to various types of data and to access data from the Storage component.\nGateKeeper checks access rights of a user for a given action.\nEmailGenerator generates emails to be sent.\nEmailSender sends email with the provider chosen based on the build configuration.\nIt connects to the email provider by using the appropriate Service class.\nTaskQueuer adds tasks to the task queue.\nIt connects to GAE's task queue API.\nTo access control the following information are presented.\nAlthough this component provides methods to perform access control, the API itself is not access controlled.\nThe UI is expected to check access control (using GateKeeper class) before calling a method in the Logic.\nTo API for creating entities the following information are presented.\nNull parameters causes an assertion failure.\nInvalid parameters throws InvalidParametersException.\nEntity already exists throws EntityAlreadyExistsException (escalated from Storage level).\nTo API for retrieving entities the following information are presented.\nAttempting to retrieve objects using null parameters causes an assertion failure.\nEntity not found returns null if the target entity not found.\nThis way, read operations can be used easily for checking the existence of an entity.\nTo API for updating entities the following information are presented.\nUpdate is done using UpdateOptions inside every Attributes.\nThe UpdateOptions will specify what is used to identify the entity to update and what will be updated.\nEntity not found throws EntityDoesNotExistException.\nInvalid parameters throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for deleting entities the following information are presented.\nThe following explains the FailDeleteSilentlyPolicy.\nIn general, delete operation do not throw exceptions if the target entity does not exist.\nThis is because if it does not exist, it is as good as deleted.\nThe following explains the Cascade policy.\nWhen a parent entity is deleted, entities that have referential integrity with the deleted entity should also be deleted.\nRefer to the API for the cascade logic.\nThe Storage component performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data entities individually.\nIt contains minimal logic beyond what is directly relevant to CRUD operations.\nIn particular, it is reponsible for the following.\nValidating data inside entities before creating/updating them, to ensure they are in a valid state.\nHiding the complexities of datastore from the Logic component.\nAll GQL queries are to be contained inside the Storage component.\nHiding the persistable objects.\nClasses in the storage.entity package are not visible outside this component to hide information specific to data persistence.\nInstead, a corresponding non-persistent data transfer object named Attributes (e.g., CourseAttributes is the data transfer object for Course entities) object is returned.\nThese datatransfer classes are in common.datatransfer package, to be explained later.\nThe Storage component does not perform any cascade delete/create operations.\nCascade logic is handled by the Logic component.\nPackage overview contains storage.api, storage.entity, storage.search.\nstorage.api provides the API of the component to be accessed by the logic component.\nstorage.entity contains classes that represent persistable entities.\nstorage.search contains classes for dealing with searching and indexing.\nNote that the navigability of the association links between entity objects appear to be in the reverse direction of what we see in a normal OOP design.\nThis is because we want to keep the data schema flexible so that new entity types can be added later with minimal modifications to existing elements.\nRepresented by the Db classes.\nThese classes act as the bridge to the GAE Datastore.\nAdd and Delete operations try to wait until data is persisted in the datastore before returning.\nThis is not enough to compensate for eventual consistency involving multiple servers in the GAE production environment.\nHowever, it is expected to avoid test failures caused by eventual consistency in dev server and reduce such problems in the live server.\nEventual consistency here means it takes some time for a database operation to propagate across all serves of the Google's distributed datastore.\nAs a result, the data may be in an inconsistent states for short periods of time although things should become consistent eventually.\nFor example, an object we deleted may appear to still exist for a short while.\nImplementation of Transaction Control has been minimized due to limitations of GAE environment and the nature of our data schema.\nTo API for creating the following information are presented.\nAttempt to create an entity that already exists throws EntityAlreadyExistsException.\nAttempt to create an entity with invalid data throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for retrieving the following information are presented.\nAttempt to retrieve an entity that does not exist returns null.\nTo API for updating the following information are presented.\nAttempt to update an entity that does not exist throws EntityDoesNotExistException.\nAttempt to update an entity with invalid data throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for deleting the following information are presented.\nAttempt to delete an entity that does not exist fails silently.\nThe Common component contains common utilities used across TEAMMATES.\nPackage overview contains common.util, common.exceptions, common.datatransfer.\ncommon.util contains utility classes.\ncommon.exceptions contains custom exceptions.\ncommon.datatransfer contains data transfer objects.\ncommon.datatransfer package contains lightweight data transfer object classes for transferring data among components.\nThey can be combined in various ways to transfer structured data between components.\nGiven below are three examples.\nTest Driver can use the DataBundle in this manner to send an arbitrary number of objects to be persisted in the database.\nThis structure can be used to transfer data of a course (e.g., when constructing the home page for an instructor).\nThis structure can be used to send results of a feedback session (e.g., when showing a feedback session report to an instructor).\nSome of these classes are methodless and thus more of a data structure rather than a class.\nThese classes use public variables for data for easy access.\nThis component automates the testing of TEAMMATES.\nPackage overview contains test.driver, test.cases and subpackages.\ntest.driver contains infrastructure and helpers needed for running the tests.\ntest.cases contains test cases.\nSub-packages contains x.testdriver, x.datatransfer, x.util, x.logic, x.storage, x.search, x.webapi, x.automated.\nx.testdriver contains component test cases for testing the test driver infrastructure and helpers.\nx.datatransfer contains component test cases for testing the datatransfer objects from the Common component.\nx.util contains component test cases for testing the utility classes from the Common component.\nx.logic contains component test cases for testing the Logic component.\nx.storage contains component test cases for testing the Storage component.\nx.search contains component test cases for testing the search functions.\nx.webapi contains system test cases for testing the user-invoked actions.\nx.automated contains system test cases for testing the system-automated actions (manually invoked during testing).\nSome Component tests are pure unit tests (i.e. testing one component in isolation) while others are integration tests that test units as well as integration of units with each other.\nFront-end files (particularly TypeScript) are tested separately with Jest.\nThe test cases are found in x.spec.ts files.\nThis is how TEAMMATES testing maps to standard types of testing.\nThe E2E component has no knowledge of the internal workings of the application and can only interact either with Web browser as a whole application or REST API calls for the back-end logic.\nIts primary function is for E2E tests and L&P (Load & Performance) tests.\nPackage overview contains e2e.util, e2e.pageobjects, e2e.cases, x.util, x.e2e, x.lnp.\ne2e.util contains helpers needed for running E2E tests.\ne2e.pageobjects contains abstractions of the pages as they appear on a Browser (i.e. SUTs).\ne2e.cases contains test cases.\nx.util contains component test cases for testing the test helpers.\nx.e2e contains system test cases for testing the application as a whole.\nx.lnp contains load and performance tests (experimental).\nThe Client component contains scripts that can connect directly to the application back-end for administrative purposes, such as migrating data to a new schema and calculating statistics.\nPackage overview contains client.util, client.remoteapi, client.scripts.\nclient.util contains helpers needed for client scripts.\nclient.remoteapi classes needed to connect to the back end

In a first step, you shall elaborate on the following documentation:\n\nHigh-level architecture.\nThe following diagram provides a high-level view of how BigBlueButton's components work together.\nWe'll break down each component in more detail below.\n\n\nHTML5 client.\n\nThe HTML5 client is a single page, responsive web application that is built upon the following components:\nReact.js for rendering the user interface in an efficient manner, WebRTC for sending/receiving audio and video.\nThe HTML5 client connects directly with the BigBlueButton server over port 443 (SSL), from loading the BigBlueButton client to making a web socket connection. These connections are all handled by nginx.\nThe HTML5 server sits behind nginx.\nThe HTML5 server is built upon Meteor.js in ECMA2015 for communication between client and server and upon MongoDB for keeping the state of each BigBlueButton client consistent with the BigBlueButton server.\nThe MongoDB database contains information about all meetings on the server and, in turn, each client connected to a meeting.\nEach user's client is only aware of the their meeting's state, such the user's public and private chat messages sent and received. The client side subscribes to the published collections on the server side.\nUpdates to MongoDB on the server side are automatically pushed to MiniMongo on the client side.\nThe following diagram gives an overview of the architecture of the HTML5 client and its communications with the other components in BigBlueButton.\n\n\nScalability of HTML5 server component.\n\nBigBlueButton 2.2 used a single nodejs process for all client-side communication.\nThis process would start to bottleneck (the nodejs process, running on a single CPU core, started to use 100% of the core).\nBecause nodejs was running on a single CPU core, having a 16 or 32 CPU core server for BigBlueButton 2.2 failed to yield much additional scalability.\nBigBlueButton 2.3 moves away from a single nodejs process for bbb-html5 towards multiple nodejs processes handling incoming messages from clients.\nThis means that bbb-html5 could use multiple CPU cores for processing messages and handling browser sessions (each nodejs process runs on a single CPU core).\nAs of 2.3-alpha-7, bbb-html5 uses 2 \"frontend\" and two \"backend\" processes (this value is configurable in bbb-html5-with-roles.conf, see Configuration Files).\nA restart of BigBlueButton is required if you make changes to these files.\nThe breakdown of functionality between front-end and back-end is as follows:\nFrontends receive the ValidateAuthTokenResp event to complete authentication.\nFrontends collection subscription and publishing.\nFrontends other DDP events including method calls to send events to akka-apps\nFrontends handle completely the Streamer redis events: Cursor, Annotations, External video share.\nFrontends still require MeetingStarted and MeetingEnded events to create/destroy per-meeting event processing queues.\nBackends handle all the non-streamer events.\nIf more than one backend is running, bbb-web splits the load in round-robin fashion by assigning an instanceId.\nSo individual backends only process redis events for the meetings matching the associated instanceId.\nValidateAuthTokenResp is passed to backends as well, which is needed for the cases where you only have a backend, no frontends - for example dev environments that do not need to care about scaling.\nWhen you use sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname> or sudo bbb-conf --restart, bbb-conf will run /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-conf/apply-config.sh between shutdown and restart of the BigBlueButton processes.\nIn this way, you can change configuration values of BigBlueButton, or use some of the helper functions in apply-lib.sh.\nSee \"Automatically apply configuration changes on restart\".\n\n\nBBB web.\n\nBigBlueButton web application is a Java-based application written in Scala. It implements the BigBlueButton API and holds a copy of the meeting state.\nThe BigBlueButton API provides a third-party integration (such as the BigBlueButtonBN plugin for Moodle) with an endpoint to control the BigBlueButton server.\nEvery access to BigBlueButton comes through a front-end portal (we refer to as a third-party application).\nBigBlueButton integrates Moodle, Wordpress, Canvas, Sakai, and others (see third-party integrations).\nBigBlueButton comes with its own front-end called Greenlight.\nWhen using a learning management system (LMS) such as Moodle, teachers can setup BigBlueButton rooms within their course and students can access the rooms and their recordings.\n\nThe BigBlueButton comes with some simple API demos. Regardless of which front-end you use, they all use the API under the hood.\n\n\nRedis PubSub.\n\nRedis PubSub provides a communication channel between different applications running on the BigBlueButton server.\n\n\nRedis DB.\n\nWhen a meeting is recorded, all events are stored in Redis DB.\nWhen the meeting ends, the Recording Processor will take all the recorded events as well as the different raw (PDF, WAV, FLV) files for processing.\n\n\nApps akka.\n\nBigBlueButton Apps is the main application that pulls together the different applications to provide real-time collaboration in the meeting.\nIt provides the list of users, chat, whiteboard, presentations in a meeting.\nBelow is a diagram of the different components of Apps Akka.\nThe meeting business logic is in the MeetingActor.\nThis is where information about the meeting is stored and where all messages for a meeting is processed.\n\n\nFSESL akka.\n\nWe have extracted out the component that integrates with FreeSWITCH into it’s own application. This allows others who are using voice conference systems other than FreeSWITCH to easily create their own integration. Communication between apps and FreeSWITCH Event Socket Layer (fsels) uses messages through redis pubsub.\n\n\nFreeSWITCH.\n\nWe think FreeSWITCH is an amazing piece of software for handling audio.\nFreeSWITCH provides the voice conferencing capability in BigBlueButton.\nUsers are able to join the voice conference through the headset.\nUsers joining through Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are able to take advantage of higher quality audio by connecting using WebRTC.\nFreeSWITCH can also be integrated with VOIP providers so that users who are not able to join using the headset will be able to call in using their phone.\n\n\nKurento and WebRTC-SFU.\n\nKurento Media Server KMS is a media server that implements both SFU and MCU models.\nKMS is responsible for streaming of webcams, listen-only audio, and screensharing.\nThe WebRTC-SFU acts as the media controller handling negotiations and to manage the media streams.\n\n\nJoining a voice conference.\n\nA user can join the voice conference (running in FreeSWITCH) from the BigBlueButton HTML5 client or through the phone.\nWhen joining through the client, the user can choose to join Microphone or Listen Only, and the BigBlueButton client will make an audio connection to the server via WebRTC.\nWebRTC provides the user with high-quality audio with lower delay.\n\n\nUploading a presentation.\n\nUploaded presentations go through a conversion process in order to be displayed inside the client.\nWhen the uploaded presentation is an Office document, it needs to be converted into PDF using LibreOffice.\nThe PDF document is then converted into scalable vector graphics (SVG) via bbb-web.\nThe conversion process sends progress messages to the client through the Redis pubsub.\n\n\nPresentation conversion flow.\n\nThe diagram below describes the flow of the presentation conversion.\nWe take in consideration the configuration for enabling and disabling SWF, SVG and PNG conversion.\nThen below the SVG conversion flow. It covers the conversion fallback.\nSometimes we detect that the generated SVG file is heavy to load by the browser, we use the fallback to put a rasterized image inside the SVG file and make its loading light for the browser.\n\n\nInternal network connections.\n\nThe following diagram shows how the various components of BigBlueButton connect to each other via sockets.\n\" }] }]":"\nBased on the provided documentation, here are the high-level components of BigBlueButton:\n\n1.

In a first step, you shall elaborate on the following documentation:\n\nHigh-level architecture.\nThe following diagram provides a high-level view of how BigBlueButton's components work together.\nWe'll break down each component in more detail below.\n\n\nHTML5 client.\n\nThe HTML5 client is a single page, responsive web application that is built upon the following components:\nReact.js for rendering the user interface in an efficient manner, WebRTC for sending/receiving audio and video.\nThe HTML5 client connects directly with the BigBlueButton server over port 443 (SSL), from loading the BigBlueButton client to making a web socket connection. These connections are all handled by nginx.\nThe HTML5 server sits behind nginx.\nThe HTML5 server is built upon Meteor.js in ECMA2015 for communication between client and server and upon MongoDB for keeping the state of each BigBlueButton client consistent with the BigBlueButton server.\nThe MongoDB database contains information about all meetings on the server and, in turn, each client connected to a meeting.\nEach user's client is only aware of the their meeting's state, such the user's public and private chat messages sent and received. The client side subscribes to the published collections on the server side.\nUpdates to MongoDB on the server side are automatically pushed to MiniMongo on the client side.\nThe following diagram gives an overview of the architecture of the HTML5 client and its communications with the other components in BigBlueButton.\n\n\nScalability of HTML5 server component.\n\nBigBlueButton 2.2 used a single nodejs process for all client-side communication.\nThis process would start to bottleneck (the nodejs process, running on a single CPU core, started to use 100% of the core).\nBecause nodejs was running on a single CPU core, having a 16 or 32 CPU core server for BigBlueButton 2.2 failed to yield much additional scalability.\nBigBlueButton 2.3 moves away from a single nodejs process for bbb-html5 towards multiple nodejs processes handling incoming messages from clients.\nThis means that bbb-html5 could use multiple CPU cores for processing messages and handling browser sessions (each nodejs process runs on a single CPU core).\nAs of 2.3-alpha-7, bbb-html5 uses 2 \"frontend\" and two \"backend\" processes (this value is configurable in bbb-html5-with-roles.conf, see Configuration Files).\nA restart of BigBlueButton is required if you make changes to these files.\nThe breakdown of functionality between front-end and back-end is as follows:\nFrontends receive the ValidateAuthTokenResp event to complete authentication.\nFrontends collection subscription and publishing.\nFrontends other DDP events including method calls to send events to akka-apps\nFrontends handle completely the Streamer redis events: Cursor, Annotations, External video share.\nFrontends still require MeetingStarted and MeetingEnded events to create/destroy per-meeting event processing queues.\nBackends handle all the non-streamer events.\nIf more than one backend is running, bbb-web splits the load in round-robin fashion by assigning an instanceId.\nSo individual backends only process redis events for the meetings matching the associated instanceId.\nValidateAuthTokenResp is passed to backends as well, which is needed for the cases where you only have a backend, no frontends - for example dev environments that do not need to care about scaling.\nWhen you use sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname> or sudo bbb-conf --restart, bbb-conf will run /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-conf/apply-config.sh between shutdown and restart of the BigBlueButton processes.\nIn this way, you can change configuration values of BigBlueButton, or use some of the helper functions in apply-lib.sh.\nSee \"Automatically apply configuration changes on restart\".\n\n\nBBB web.\n\nBigBlueButton web application is a Java-based application written in Scala. It implements the BigBlueButton API and holds a copy of the meeting state.\nThe BigBlueButton API provides a third-party integration (such as the BigBlueButtonBN plugin for Moodle) with an endpoint to control the BigBlueButton server.\nEvery access to BigBlueButton comes through a front-end portal (we refer to as a third-party application).\nBigBlueButton integrates Moodle, Wordpress, Canvas, Sakai, and others (see third-party integrations).\nBigBlueButton comes with its own front-end called Greenlight.\nWhen using a learning management system (LMS) such as Moodle, teachers can setup BigBlueButton rooms within their course and students can access the rooms and their recordings.\n\nThe BigBlueButton comes with some simple API demos. Regardless of which front-end you use, they all use the API under the hood.\n\n\nRedis PubSub.\n\nRedis PubSub provides a communication channel between different applications running on the BigBlueButton server.\n\n\nRedis DB.\n\nWhen a meeting is recorded, all events are stored in Redis DB.\nWhen the meeting ends, the Recording Processor will take all the recorded events as well as the different raw (PDF, WAV, FLV) files for processing.\n\n\nApps akka.\n\nBigBlueButton Apps is the main application that pulls together the different applications to provide real-time collaboration in the meeting.\nIt provides the list of users, chat, whiteboard, presentations in a meeting.\nBelow is a diagram of the different components of Apps Akka.\nThe meeting business logic is in the MeetingActor.\nThis is where information about the meeting is stored and where all messages for a meeting is processed.\n\n\nFSESL akka.\n\nWe have extracted out the component that integrates with FreeSWITCH into it’s own application. This allows others who are using voice conference systems other than FreeSWITCH to easily create their own integration. Communication between apps and FreeSWITCH Event Socket Layer (fsels) uses messages through redis pubsub.\n\n\nFreeSWITCH.\n\nWe think FreeSWITCH is an amazing piece of software for handling audio.\nFreeSWITCH provides the voice conferencing capability in BigBlueButton.\nUsers are able to join the voice conference through the headset.\nUsers joining through Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are able to take advantage of higher quality audio by connecting using WebRTC.\nFreeSWITCH can also be integrated with VOIP providers so that users who are not able to join using the headset will be able to call in using their phone.\n\n\nKurento and WebRTC-SFU.\n\nKurento Media Server KMS is a media server that implements both SFU and MCU models.\nKMS is responsible for streaming of webcams, listen-only audio, and screensharing.\nThe WebRTC-SFU acts as the media controller handling negotiations and to manage the media streams.\n\n\nJoining a voice conference.\n\nA user can join the voice conference (running in FreeSWITCH) from the BigBlueButton HTML5 client or through the phone.\nWhen joining through the client, the user can choose to join Microphone or Listen Only, and the BigBlueButton client will make an audio connection to the server via WebRTC.\nWebRTC provides the user with high-quality audio with lower delay.\n\n\nUploading a presentation.\n\nUploaded presentations go through a conversion process in order to be displayed inside the client.\nWhen the uploaded presentation is an Office document, it needs to be converted into PDF using LibreOffice.\nThe PDF document is then converted into scalable vector graphics (SVG) via bbb-web.\nThe conversion process sends progress messages to the client through the Redis pubsub.\n\n\nPresentation conversion flow.\n\nThe diagram below describes the flow of the presentation conversion.\nWe take in consideration the configuration for enabling and disabling SWF, SVG and PNG conversion.\nThen below the SVG conversion flow. It covers the conversion fallback.\nSometimes we detect that the generated SVG file is heavy to load by the browser, we use the fallback to put a rasterized image inside the SVG file and make its loading light for the browser.\n\n\nInternal network connections.\n\nThe following diagram shows how the various components of BigBlueButton connect to each other via sockets.\n\" }] }, AiMessage { text = \"\nBased on the provided documentation, here are the high-level components of BigBlueButton:\n\n1.

In a first step, you shall elaborate on the following documentation:\n\nArchitecture contains UI Component, Logic Component, Storage Component, Common Component, Test Driver Component, E2E Component, Client Component.\nTEAMMATES is a Web application that runs on Google App Engine (GAE).\nGiven above is an overview of the main components.\nThe UI Browser seen by users consists of Web pages containing HTML, CSS for styling and JavaScript for client-side interactions such as sorting, input validation, etc..\nThis UI is a single HTML page generated by Angular framework.\nThe initial page request is sent to the server over HTTP, and requests for data are sent asynchronously with AJAX.\nIn the UI Server the entry point for the application back end logic is designed as a REST-ful controller.\nThe main logic of the application is in POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).\nThe storage layer of the application uses the persistence framework provided by GAE Datastore, a NoSQL database.\nThe following explains the use of the Test Driver.\nTEAMMATES makes heavy use of automated regression testing.\nTest data is transmitted using JSON format.\nTestNG is used for Java testing (all levels) and Jest for JavaScript unit-testing.\nHttpUnit is used to set up a simulated web server in servlet-level tests, where an actual web server is not required.\nThe E2E end-to-end component is used to interact with the application as a whole with Web browsers.\nIts primary function is for E2E tests.\nSelenium Java is used to automate E2E testing with actual Web browsers.\nThe Client component can connect to the back end directly without using a Web browser.\nIt is used for administrative purposes, e.g. migrating data to a new schema.\nThe Common component contains utility code (data transfer objects, helper classes, etc.) used across the application.\nThe diagram below shows how the code in each component is organized into packages and the dependencies between them.\nlogic, ui.website, ui.controller represent an application of Model-View-Controller pattern.\nui.website is not a real package.\nIt is a conceptual package representing the front-end of the application.\nThe diagram below shows the object structure of the UI component.\nui.website is not a Java package.\nIt is written in Angular framework and consists of HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript files.\nThe framework will build those files into HTML, CSS and JavaScript files ready to be used by standard Web browsers.\nThe UI component is the first stop for 99% of all requests that are received by the application.\nSuch a request will go through the following steps.\nFirst, request received by the GAE server.\nSecond, custom filters are applied according to the order specified in web.xml, e.g. OriginCheckFilter.\nThird, request forwarded to a Servlet object as specified in web.xml for further processing, depending on the type of request.\nThere are two general types of requests.\nThe user-invoked requests and the automated (GAE server-invoked) requests, which are processed differently.\nUser-invoked requests are all requests made by the users of the application, typically from the Web browser (i.e. by navigating to a particular URL of the application).\nThe request will be processed as in the image.\nThe initial request for the web page will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to WebPageServlet.\nSecond, WebPageServlet returns the built single web page (index.html).\nThird, the browser will render the page and execute the page scripts, most of the time requiring AJAX requests to the server.\nSubsequent AJAX requests sent to the server will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to the WebApiServlet.\nSecond, WebApiServlet uses the ActionFactory to generate the matching Action object, e.g. InstructorHomePageAction.\nThird, WebApiServlet executes the action.\nFourth, the Action object checks the access rights of the user.\nIf the action is allowed, it will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nFifth, the Action packages and processes the result into an ActionResult object.\nThe most common format is JsonResult (requests for obtaining data or processing existing data), and other formats are defined as necessary, e.g. FileDownloadResult (e.g. downloading feedback session report) and ImageResult (e.g. profile pictures).\nSixth, WebApiServlet sends the result back to the browser which will then process it on the front-end.\nRequests for static asset files (e.g. CSS, JS files, images) are served directly without going through web.xml configuration at all.\nThe Web API is protected by two layers of access control check.\nThese are origin check, authentication and authorization check.\nOrigin check mitigates CSRF attack.\nAuthentication and authorization check checks if the logged in user (or lack thereof) has sufficient privileges to trigger the API's actions.\nSpecial keys (csrf key and backdoor key) can be used to bypass each of the checks, typically for testing purpose.\nThose keys are strings known only to the person who deployed the application (typically, the administrator).\nAutomated requests are all requests sent automatically by the GAE server during specific periods of time.\nThis type of request will be processed as follows.\nFirst, the source of the request will be checked for administrator privilege.\nIf this privilege is absent (e.g. non-administrator users trying to invoke the automated actions), the request will be dropped and a 403 Forbidden status will be returned.\nSecond, requests generated by the GAE server are equipped with this privilege.\nThird, administrators can manually invoke these requests.\nThis is particularly useful in testing the actions associated with those requests.\nFourth, request forwarded to the AutomatedServlet.\nFifth, automatedServlet uses the AutomatedActionFactory to generate the matching AutomatedAction object, e.g. CompileLogsAction.\nSixth, automatedServlet executes the action.\nSeventh, the corresponding AutomatedAction will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nGAE server sends such automated requests through two different configurations.\nThese configurations are cron jobs or task queue workers.\nCron jobs are jobs that are automatically scheduled for a specified period of time, e.g. scheduling feedback session opening reminders.\nIt is configured in cron.xml.\nTask queue workers are hybrids of user-invoked and GAE-invoked in that they are queued by users (i.e. users request for the tasks to be added to queue), but executed by GAE (i.e. GAE determines when and which tasks in the queue are executed at any point of time).\nThis is typically used for tasks that may take a long time to finish and can exceed the 1 minute standard request processing limit imposed by GAE.\nIt is configured in queue.xml as well as the TaskQueue nested class of the Const class.\nSince the high-level workflow of processing a request is same for any request (differing by the two request types only), we use the Template Method pattern to abstract the process flow into the Action and AutomatedAction classes.\nThe Logic component handles the business logic of TEAMMATES.\nIn particular, it is responsible for the following.\nManaging relationships between entities, e.g. cascade logic for create/update/delete.\nManaging transactions, e.g. ensuring atomicity of a transaction.\nSanitizing input values received from the UI component.\nProviding a mechanism for checking access control rights.\nConnecting to GAE-provided or third-party APIs, e.g. for adding tasks to the task queue and for sending emails with third-party providers.\nPackage overview contains logic.api, logic.core.\nlogic.api provides the API of the component to be accessed by the UI.\nlogic.core contains the core logic of the system.\nLogic API is represented by the classes Logic, GateKeeper, EmailGenerator, EmailSender, TaskQueuer.\nLogic is a Facade class which connects to the several Logic classes to handle the logic related to various types of data and to access data from the Storage component.\nGateKeeper checks access rights of a user for a given action.\nEmailGenerator generates emails to be sent.\nEmailSender sends email with the provider chosen based on the build configuration.\nIt connects to the email provider by using the appropriate Service class.\nTaskQueuer adds tasks to the task queue.\nIt connects to GAE's task queue API.\nTo access control the following information are presented.\nAlthough this component provides methods to perform access control, the API itself is not access controlled.\nThe UI is expected to check access control (using GateKeeper class) before calling a method in the Logic.\nTo API for creating entities the following information are presented.\nNull parameters causes an assertion failure.\nInvalid parameters throws InvalidParametersException.\nEntity already exists throws EntityAlreadyExistsException (escalated from Storage level).\nTo API for retrieving entities the following information are presented.\nAttempting to retrieve objects using null parameters causes an assertion failure.\nEntity not found returns null if the target entity not found.\nThis way, read operations can be used easily for checking the existence of an entity.\nTo API for updating entities the following information are presented.\nUpdate is done using UpdateOptions inside every Attributes.\nThe UpdateOptions will specify what is used to identify the entity to update and what will be updated.\nEntity not found throws EntityDoesNotExistException.\nInvalid parameters throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for deleting entities the following information are presented.\nThe following explains the FailDeleteSilentlyPolicy.\nIn general, delete operation do not throw exceptions if the target entity does not exist.\nThis is because if it does not exist, it is as good as deleted.\nThe following explains the Cascade policy.\nWhen a parent entity is deleted, entities that have referential integrity with the deleted entity should also be deleted.\nRefer to the API for the cascade logic.\nThe Storage component performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data entities individually.\nIt contains minimal logic beyond what is directly relevant to CRUD operations.\nIn particular, it is reponsible for the following.\nValidating data inside entities before creating/updating them, to ensure they are in a valid state.\nHiding the complexities of datastore from the Logic component.\nAll GQL queries are to be contained inside the Storage component.\nHiding the persistable objects.\nClasses in the storage.entity package are not visible outside this component to hide information specific to data persistence.\nInstead, a corresponding non-persistent data transfer object named Attributes (e.g., CourseAttributes is the data transfer object for Course entities) object is returned.\nThese datatransfer classes are in common.datatransfer package, to be explained later.\nThe Storage component does not perform any cascade delete/create operations.\nCascade logic is handled by the Logic component.\nPackage overview contains storage.api, storage.entity, storage.search.\nstorage.api provides the API of the component to be accessed by the logic component.\nstorage.entity contains classes that represent persistable entities.\nstorage.search contains classes for dealing with searching and indexing.\nNote that the navigability of the association links between entity objects appear to be in the reverse direction of what we see in a normal OOP design.\nThis is because we want to keep the data schema flexible so that new entity types can be added later with minimal modifications to existing elements.\nRepresented by the Db classes.\nThese classes act as the bridge to the GAE Datastore.\nAdd and Delete operations try to wait until data is persisted in the datastore before returning.\nThis is not enough to compensate for eventual consistency involving multiple servers in the GAE production environment.\nHowever, it is expected to avoid test failures caused by eventual consistency in dev server and reduce such problems in the live server.\nEventual consistency here means it takes some time for a database operation to propagate across all serves of the Google's distributed datastore.\nAs a result, the data may be in an inconsistent states for short periods of time although things should become consistent eventually.\nFor example, an object we deleted may appear to still exist for a short while.\nImplementation of Transaction Control has been minimized due to limitations of GAE environment and the nature of our data schema.\nTo API for creating the following information are presented.\nAttempt to create an entity that already exists throws EntityAlreadyExistsException.\nAttempt to create an entity with invalid data throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for retrieving the following information are presented.\nAttempt to retrieve an entity that does not exist returns null.\nTo API for updating the following information are presented.\nAttempt to update an entity that does not exist throws EntityDoesNotExistException.\nAttempt to update an entity with invalid data throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for deleting the following information are presented.\nAttempt to delete an entity that does not exist fails silently.\nThe Common component contains common utilities used across TEAMMATES.\nPackage overview contains common.util, common.exceptions, common.datatransfer.\ncommon.util contains utility classes.\ncommon.exceptions contains custom exceptions.\ncommon.datatransfer contains data transfer objects.\ncommon.datatransfer package contains lightweight data transfer object classes for transferring data among components.\nThey can be combined in various ways to transfer structured data between components.\nGiven below are three examples.\nTest Driver can use the DataBundle in this manner to send an arbitrary number of objects to be persisted in the database.\nThis structure can be used to transfer data of a course (e.g., when constructing the home page for an instructor).\nThis structure can be used to send results of a feedback session (e.g., when showing a feedback session report to an instructor).\nSome of these classes are methodless and thus more of a data structure rather than a class.\nThese classes use public variables for data for easy access.\nThis component automates the testing of TEAMMATES.\nPackage overview contains test.driver, test.cases and subpackages.\ntest.driver contains infrastructure and helpers needed for running the tests.\ntest.cases contains test cases.\nSub-packages contains x.testdriver, x.datatransfer, x.util, x.logic, x.storage, x.search, x.webapi, x.automated.\nx.testdriver contains component test cases for testing the test driver infrastructure and helpers.\nx.datatransfer contains component test cases for testing the datatransfer objects from the Common component.\nx.util contains component test cases for testing the utility

contains component test cases for testing the search functions.\nx.webapi contains system test cases for testing the user-invoked actions.\nx.automated contains system test cases for testing the system-automated actions (manually invoked during testing).\nSome Component tests are pure unit tests (i.e. testing one component in isolation) while others are integration tests that test units as well as integration of units with each other.\nFront-end files (particularly TypeScript) are tested separately with Jest.\nThe test cases are found in x.spec.ts files.\nThis is how TEAMMATES testing maps to standard types of testing.\nThe E2E component has no knowledge of the internal workings of the application and can only interact either with Web browser as a whole application or REST API calls for the back-end logic.\nIts primary function is for E2E tests and L&P (Load & Performance) tests.\nPackage overview contains e2e.util, e2e.pageobjects, e2e.cases, x.util, x.e2e, x.lnp.\ne2e.util contains helpers needed for running E2E tests.\ne2e.pageobjects contains abstractions of the pages as they appear on a Browser (i.e. SUTs).\ne2e.cases contains test cases.\nx.util contains component test cases for testing the test helpers.\nx.e2e contains system test cases for testing the application as a whole.\nx.lnp contains load and performance tests (experimental).\nThe Client component contains scripts that can connect directly to the application back-end for administrative purposes, such as migrating data to a new schema and calculating statistics.\nPackage overview contains client.util, client.remoteapi, client.scripts.\nclient.util contains helpers needed for client scripts.\nclient.remoteapi classes needed to connect to the back end

In a first step, you shall elaborate on the following documentation:\n\nHigh-level architecture.\nThe following diagram provides a high-level view of how BigBlueButton's components work together.\nWe'll break down each component in more detail below.\n\n\nHTML5 client.\n\nThe HTML5 client is a single page, responsive web application that is built upon the following components:\nReact.js for rendering the user interface in an efficient manner, WebRTC for sending/receiving audio and video.\nThe HTML5 client connects directly with the BigBlueButton server over port 443 (SSL), from loading the BigBlueButton client to making a web socket connection. These connections are all handled by nginx.\nThe HTML5 server sits behind nginx.\nThe HTML5 server is built upon Meteor.js in ECMA2015 for communication between client and server and upon MongoDB for keeping the state of each BigBlueButton client consistent with the BigBlueButton server.\nThe MongoDB database contains information about all meetings on the server and, in turn, each client connected to a meeting.\nEach user's client is only aware of the their meeting's state, such the user's public and private chat messages sent and received. The client side subscribes to the published collections on the server side.\nUpdates to MongoDB on the server side are automatically pushed to MiniMongo on the client side.\nThe following diagram gives an overview of the architecture of the HTML5 client and its communications with the other components in BigBlueButton.\n\n\nScalability of HTML5 server component.\n\nBigBlueButton 2.2 used a single nodejs process for all client-side communication.\nThis process would start to bottleneck (the nodejs process, running on a single CPU core, started to use 100% of the core).\nBecause nodejs was running on a single CPU core, having a 16 or 32 CPU core server for BigBlueButton 2.2 failed to yield much additional scalability.\nBigBlueButton 2.3 moves away from a single nodejs process for bbb-html5 towards multiple nodejs processes handling incoming messages from clients.\nThis means that bbb-html5 could use multiple CPU cores for processing messages and handling browser sessions (each nodejs process runs on a single CPU core).\nAs of 2.3-alpha-7, bbb-html5 uses 2 \"frontend\" and two \"backend\" processes (this value is configurable in bbb-html5-with-roles.conf, see Configuration Files).\nA restart of BigBlueButton is required if you make changes to these files.\nThe breakdown of functionality between front-end and back-end is as follows:\nFrontends receive the ValidateAuthTokenResp event to complete authentication.\nFrontends collection subscription and publishing.\nFrontends other DDP events including method calls to send events to akka-apps\nFrontends handle completely the Streamer redis events: Cursor, Annotations, External video share.\nFrontends still require MeetingStarted and MeetingEnded events to create/destroy per-meeting event processing queues.\nBackends handle all the non-streamer events.\nIf more than one backend is running, bbb-web splits the load in round-robin fashion by assigning an instanceId.\nSo individual backends only process redis events for the meetings matching the associated instanceId.\nValidateAuthTokenResp is passed to backends as well, which is needed for the cases where you only have a backend, no frontends - for example dev environments that do not need to care about scaling.\nWhen you use sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname> or sudo bbb-conf --restart, bbb-conf will run /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-conf/apply-config.sh between shutdown and restart of the BigBlueButton processes.\nIn this way, you can change configuration values of BigBlueButton, or use some of the helper functions in apply-lib.sh.\nSee \"Automatically apply configuration changes on restart\".\n\n\nBBB web.\n\nBigBlueButton web application is a Java-based application written in Scala. It implements the BigBlueButton API and holds a copy of the meeting state.\nThe BigBlueButton API provides a third-party integration (such as the BigBlueButtonBN plugin for Moodle) with an endpoint to control the BigBlueButton server.\nEvery access to BigBlueButton comes through a front-end portal (we refer to as a third-party application).\nBigBlueButton integrates Moodle, Wordpress, Canvas, Sakai, and others (see third-party integrations).\nBigBlueButton comes with its own front-end called Greenlight.\nWhen using a learning management system (LMS) such as Moodle, teachers can setup BigBlueButton rooms within their course and students can access the rooms and their recordings.\n\nThe BigBlueButton comes with some simple API demos. Regardless of which front-end you use, they all use the API under the hood.\n\n\nRedis PubSub.\n\nRedis PubSub provides a communication channel between different applications running on the BigBlueButton server.\n\n\nRedis DB.\n\nWhen a meeting is recorded, all events are stored in Redis DB.\nWhen the meeting ends, the Recording Processor will take all the recorded events as well as the different raw (PDF, WAV, FLV) files for processing.\n\n\nApps akka.\n\nBigBlueButton Apps is the main application that pulls together the different applications to provide real-time collaboration in the meeting.\nIt provides the list of users, chat, whiteboard, presentations in a meeting.\nBelow is a diagram of the different components of Apps Akka.\nThe meeting business logic is in the MeetingActor.\nThis is where information about the meeting is stored and where all messages for a meeting is processed.\n\n\nFSESL akka.\n\nWe have extracted out the component that integrates with FreeSWITCH into it’s own application. This allows others who are using voice conference systems other than FreeSWITCH to easily create their own integration. Communication between apps and FreeSWITCH Event Socket Layer (fsels) uses messages through redis pubsub.\n\n\nFreeSWITCH.\n\nWe think FreeSWITCH is an amazing piece of software for handling audio.\nFreeSWITCH provides the voice conferencing capability in BigBlueButton.\nUsers are able to join the voice conference through the headset.\nUsers joining through Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox are able to take advantage of higher quality audio by connecting using WebRTC.\nFreeSWITCH can also be integrated with VOIP providers so that users who are not able to join using the headset will be able to call in using their phone.\n\n\nKurento and WebRTC-SFU.\n\nKurento Media Server KMS is a media server that implements both SFU and MCU models.\nKMS is responsible for streaming of webcams, listen-only audio, and screensharing.\nThe WebRTC-SFU acts as the media controller handling negotiations and to manage the media streams.\n\n\nJoining a voice conference.\n\nA user can join the voice conference (running in FreeSWITCH) from the BigBlueButton HTML5 client or through the phone.\nWhen joining through the client, the user can choose to join Microphone or Listen Only, and the BigBlueButton client will make an audio connection to the server via WebRTC.\nWebRTC provides the user with high-quality audio with lower delay.\n\n\nUploading a presentation.\n\nUploaded presentations go through a conversion process in order to be displayed inside the client.\nWhen the uploaded presentation is an Office document, it needs to be converted into PDF using LibreOffice.\nThe PDF document is then converted into scalable vector graphics (SVG) via bbb-web.\nThe conversion process sends progress messages to the client through the Redis pubsub.\n\n\nPresentation conversion flow.\n\nThe diagram below describes the flow of the presentation conversion.\nWe take in consideration the configuration for enabling and disabling SWF, SVG and PNG conversion.\nThen below the SVG conversion flow. It covers the conversion fallback.\nSometimes we detect that the generated SVG file is heavy to load by the browser, we use the fallback to put a rasterized image inside the SVG file and make its loading light for the browser.\n\n\nInternal network connections.\n\nThe following diagram shows how the various components of BigBlueButton connect to each other via sockets.\n\" }] }, AiMessage { text = \"\nBased on the provided documentation, here are the high-level components of BigBlueButton:\n\n1.
