In a first step, you shall elaborate on the following documentation:\n\nArchitecture contains UI Component, Logic Component, Storage Component, Common Component, Test Driver Component, E2E Component, Client Component.\nTEAMMATES is a Web application that runs on Google App Engine (GAE).\nGiven above is an overview of the main components.\nThe UI Browser seen by users consists of Web pages containing HTML, CSS for styling and JavaScript for client-side interactions such as sorting, input validation, etc..\nThis UI is a single HTML page generated by Angular framework.\nThe initial page request is sent to the server over HTTP, and requests for data are sent asynchronously with AJAX.\nIn the UI Server the entry point for the application back end logic is designed as a REST-ful controller.\nThe main logic of the application is in POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).\nThe storage layer of the application uses the persistence framework provided by GAE Datastore, a NoSQL database.\nThe following explains the use of the Test Driver.\nTEAMMATES makes heavy use of automated regression testing.\nTest data is transmitted using JSON format.\nTestNG is used for Java testing (all levels) and Jest for JavaScript unit-testing.\nHttpUnit is used to set up a simulated web server in servlet-level tests, where an actual web server is not required.\nThe E2E end-to-end component is used to interact with the application as a whole with Web browsers.\nIts primary function is for E2E tests.\nSelenium Java is used to automate E2E testing with actual Web browsers.\nThe Client component can connect to the back end directly without using a Web browser.\nIt is used for administrative purposes, e.g. migrating data to a new schema.\nThe Common component contains utility code (data transfer objects, helper classes, etc.) used across the application.\nThe diagram below shows how the code in each component is organized into packages and the dependencies between them.\nlogic, ui.website, ui.controller represent an application of Model-View-Controller pattern.\nui.website is not a real package.\nIt is a conceptual package representing the front-end of the application.\nThe diagram below shows the object structure of the UI component.\nui.website is not a Java package.\nIt is written in Angular framework and consists of HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript files.\nThe framework will build those files into HTML, CSS and JavaScript files ready to be used by standard Web browsers.\nThe UI component is the first stop for 99% of all requests that are received by the application.\nSuch a request will go through the following steps.\nFirst, request received by the GAE server.\nSecond, custom filters are applied according to the order specified in web.xml, e.g. OriginCheckFilter.\nThird, request forwarded to a Servlet object as specified in web.xml for further processing, depending on the type of request.\nThere are two general types of requests.\nThe user-invoked requests and the automated (GAE server-invoked) requests, which are processed differently.\nUser-invoked requests are all requests made by the users of the application, typically from the Web browser (i.e. by navigating to a particular URL of the application).\nThe request will be processed as in the image.\nThe initial request for the web page will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to WebPageServlet.\nSecond, WebPageServlet returns the built single web page (index.html).\nThird, the browser will render the page and execute the page scripts, most of the time requiring AJAX requests to the server.\nSubsequent AJAX requests sent to the server will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to the WebApiServlet.\nSecond, WebApiServlet uses the ActionFactory to generate the matching Action object, e.g. InstructorHomePageAction.\nThird, WebApiServlet executes the action.\nFourth, the Action object checks the access rights of the user.\nIf the action is allowed, it will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nFifth, the Action packages and processes the result into an ActionResult object.\nThe most common format is JsonResult (requests for obtaining data or processing existing data), and other formats are defined as necessary, e.g. FileDownloadResult (e.g. downloading feedback session report) and ImageResult (e.g. profile pictures).\nSixth, WebApiServlet sends the result back to the browser which will then process it on the front-end.\nRequests for static asset files (e.g. CSS, JS files, images) are served directly without going through web.xml configuration at all.\nThe Web API is protected by two layers of access control check.\nThese are origin check, authentication and authorization check.\nOrigin check mitigates CSRF attack.\nAuthentication and authorization check checks if the logged in user (or lack thereof) has sufficient privileges to trigger the API's actions.\nSpecial keys (csrf key and backdoor key) can be used to bypass each of the checks, typically for testing purpose.\nThose keys are strings known only to the person who deployed the application (typically, the administrator).\nAutomated requests are all requests sent automatically by the GAE server during specific periods of time.\nThis type of request will be processed as follows.\nFirst, the source of the request will be checked for administrator privilege.\nIf this privilege is absent (e.g. non-administrator users trying to invoke the automated actions), the request will be dropped and a 403 Forbidden status will be returned.\nSecond, requests generated by the GAE server are equipped with this privilege.\nThird, administrators can manually invoke these requests.\nThis is particularly useful in testing the actions associated with those requests.\nFourth, request forwarded to the AutomatedServlet.\nFifth, automatedServlet uses the AutomatedActionFactory to generate the matching AutomatedAction object, e.g. CompileLogsAction.\nSixth, automatedServlet executes the action.\nSeventh, the corresponding AutomatedAction will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nGAE server sends such automated requests through two different configurations.\nThese configurations are cron jobs or task queue workers.\nCron jobs are jobs that are automatically scheduled for a specified period of time, e.g. scheduling feedback session opening reminders.\nIt is configured in cron.xml.\nTask queue workers are hybrids of user-invoked and GAE-invoked in that they are queued by users (i.e. users request for the tasks to be added to queue), but executed by GAE (i.e. GAE determines when and which tasks in the queue are executed at any point of time).\nThis is typically used for tasks that may take a long time to finish and can exceed the 1 minute standard request processing limit imposed by GAE.\nIt is configured in queue.xml as well as the TaskQueue nested class of the Const class.\nSince the high-level workflow of processing a request is same for any request (differing by the two request types only), we use the Template Method pattern to abstract the process flow into the Action and AutomatedAction classes.\nThe Logic component handles the business logic of TEAMMATES.\nIn particular, it is responsible for the following.\nManaging relationships between entities, e.g. cascade logic for create/update/delete.\nManaging transactions, e.g. ensuring atomicity of a transaction.\nSanitizing input values received from the UI component.\nProviding a mechanism for checking access control rights.\nConnecting to GAE-provided or third-party APIs, e.g. for adding tasks to the task queue and for sending emails with third-party providers.\nPackage overview contains logic.api, logic.core.\nlogic.api provides the API of the component to be accessed by the UI.\nlogic.core contains the core logic of the system.\nLogic API is represented by the classes Logic, GateKeeper, EmailGenerator, EmailSender, TaskQueuer.\nLogic is a Facade class which connects to the several Logic classes to handle the logic related to various types of data and to access data from the Storage component.\nGateKeeper checks access rights of a user for a given action.\nEmailGenerator generates emails to be sent.\nEmailSender sends email with the

check access control (using GateKeeper class) before calling a method in the Logic.\nTo API for creating entities the following information are presented.\nNull parameters causes an assertion failure.\nInvalid parameters throws InvalidParametersException.\nEntity already exists throws EntityAlreadyExistsException (escalated from Storage level).\nTo API for retrieving entities the following information are presented.\nAttempting to retrieve objects using null parameters causes an assertion failure.\nEntity not found returns null if the target entity not found.\nThis way, read operations can be used easily for checking the existence of an entity.\nTo API for updating entities the following information are presented.\nUpdate is done using UpdateOptions inside every Attributes.\nThe UpdateOptions will specify what is used to identify the entity to update and what will be updated.\nEntity not found throws EntityDoesNotExistException.\nInvalid parameters throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for deleting entities the following information are presented.\nThe following explains the FailDeleteSilentlyPolicy.\nIn general, delete operation do not throw exceptions if the target entity does not exist.\nThis is because if it does not exist, it is as good as deleted.\nThe following explains the Cascade policy.\nWhen a parent entity is deleted, entities that have referential integrity with the deleted entity should also be deleted.\nRefer to the API for the cascade logic.\nThe Storage component performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data entities individually.\nIt contains minimal logic beyond what is directly relevant to CRUD operations.\nIn particular, it is reponsible for the following.\nValidating data inside entities before creating/updating them, to ensure they are in a valid state.\nHiding the complexities of datastore from the Logic component.\nAll GQL queries are to be contained inside the Storage

non-persistent data transfer object named Attributes (e.g., CourseAttributes is the data transfer object for Course entities) object is returned.\nThese datatransfer classes are in common.datatransfer package, to be explained later.\nThe Storage component does not perform any cascade delete/create operations.\nCascade logic is handled by the Logic component.\nPackage overview contains storage.api, storage.entity, storage.search.\nstorage.api provides the API of the component to be accessed by the logic component.\nstorage.entity contains classes that represent persistable entities.\nstorage.search contains classes for dealing with searching and indexing.\nNote that the navigability of the association links between entity objects appear to be in the reverse direction of what we see in a normal OOP design.\nThis is because we want to keep the data schema flexible so that new entity types can be added later with minimal modifications to existing elements.\nRepresented by the Db classes.\nThese classes act as the bridge to the GAE Datastore.\nAdd and Delete operations try to wait until data is persisted in the datastore before returning.\nThis is not enough to compensate for eventual consistency involving multiple servers in the GAE production environment.\nHowever, it is expected to avoid test failures caused by eventual consistency in dev server and reduce such problems in the live server.\nEventual consistency here means it takes some time for a database operation to propagate across all serves of the Google's distributed datastore.\nAs a result, the data may be in an inconsistent states for short periods of time although things should become consistent eventually.\nFor example, an object we deleted may appear to still exist for a short while.\nImplementation of Transaction Control has been minimized due to limitations of GAE environment and the nature of our data schema.\nTo API for creating the following information are presented.\nAttempt to create an entity that already exists throws EntityAlreadyExistsException.\nAttempt to create an entity with invalid data throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for retrieving the following information are presented.\nAttempt to retrieve an entity that does not exist returns null.\nTo API for updating the following information are presented.\nAttempt to update an entity that does not exist throws EntityDoesNotExistException.\nAttempt to update an entity with invalid data throws InvalidParametersException.\nTo API for deleting the following information are

(e.g., when constructing the home page for an instructor).\nThis structure can be used to send results of a feedback session (e.g., when showing a feedback session report to an instructor).\nSome of

In a first step, you shall elaborate on the following documentation:\n\nArchitecture contains UI Component, Logic Component, Storage Component, Common Component, Test Driver Component, E2E Component, Client Component.\nTEAMMATES is a Web application that runs on Google App Engine (GAE).\nGiven above is an overview of the main components.\nThe UI Browser seen by users consists of Web pages containing HTML, CSS for styling and JavaScript for client-side interactions such as sorting, input validation, etc..\nThis UI is a single HTML page generated by Angular framework.\nThe initial page request is sent to the server over HTTP, and requests for data are sent asynchronously with AJAX.\nIn the UI Server the entry point for the application back end logic is designed as a REST-ful controller.\nThe main logic of the application is in POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).\nThe storage layer of the application uses the persistence framework provided by GAE Datastore, a NoSQL database.\nThe following explains the use of the Test Driver.\nTEAMMATES makes heavy use of automated regression testing.\nTest data is transmitted using JSON format.\nTestNG is used for Java testing (all levels) and Jest for JavaScript unit-testing.\nHttpUnit is used to set up a simulated web server in servlet-level tests, where an actual web server is not required.\nThe E2E end-to-end component is used to interact with the application as a whole with Web browsers.\nIts primary function is for E2E tests.\nSelenium Java is used to automate E2E testing with actual Web browsers.\nThe Client component can connect to the back end directly without using a Web browser.\nIt is used for administrative purposes, e.g. migrating data to a new schema.\nThe Common component contains utility code (data transfer objects, helper classes, etc.) used across the application.\nThe diagram below shows how the code in each component is organized into packages and the dependencies between them.\nlogic, ui.website, ui.controller represent an application of Model-View-Controller pattern.\nui.website is not a real package.\nIt is a conceptual package representing the front-end of the application.\nThe diagram below shows the object structure of the UI component.\nui.website is not a Java package.\nIt is written in Angular framework and consists of HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript files.\nThe framework will build those files into HTML, CSS and JavaScript files ready to be used by standard Web browsers.\nThe UI component is the first stop for 99% of all requests that are received by the application.\nSuch a request will go through the following steps.\nFirst, request received by the GAE server.\nSecond, custom filters are applied according to the order specified in web.xml, e.g. OriginCheckFilter.\nThird, request forwarded to a Servlet object as specified in web.xml for further processing, depending on the type of request.\nThere are two general types of requests.\nThe user-invoked requests and the automated (GAE server-invoked) requests, which are processed differently.\nUser-invoked requests are all requests made by the users of the application, typically from the Web browser (i.e. by navigating to a particular URL of the application).\nThe request will be processed as in the image.\nThe initial request for the web page will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to WebPageServlet.\nSecond, WebPageServlet returns the built single web page (index.html).\nThird, the browser will render the page and execute the page scripts, most of the time requiring AJAX requests to the server.\nSubsequent AJAX requests sent to the server will be processed as follows.\nFirst, request forwarded to the WebApiServlet.\nSecond, WebApiServlet uses the ActionFactory to generate the matching Action object, e.g. InstructorHomePageAction.\nThird, WebApiServlet executes the action.\nFourth, the Action object checks the access rights of the user.\nIf the action is allowed, it will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nFifth, the Action packages and processes the result into an ActionResult object.\nThe most common format is JsonResult (requests for obtaining data or processing existing data), and other formats are defined as necessary, e.g. FileDownloadResult (e.g. downloading feedback session report) and ImageResult (e.g. profile pictures).\nSixth, WebApiServlet sends the result back to the browser which will then process it on the front-end.\nRequests for static asset files (e.g. CSS, JS files, images) are served directly without going through web.xml configuration at all.\nThe Web API is protected by two layers of access control check.\nThese are origin check, authentication and authorization check.\nOrigin check mitigates CSRF attack.\nAuthentication and authorization check checks if the logged in user (or lack thereof) has sufficient privileges to trigger the API's actions.\nSpecial keys (csrf key and backdoor key) can be used to bypass each of the checks, typically for testing purpose.\nThose keys are strings known only to the person who deployed the application (typically, the administrator).\nAutomated requests are all requests sent automatically by the GAE server during specific periods of time.\nThis type of request will be processed as follows.\nFirst, the source of the request will be checked for administrator privilege.\nIf this privilege is absent (e.g. non-administrator users trying to invoke the automated actions), the request will be dropped and a 403 Forbidden status will be returned.\nSecond, requests generated by the GAE server are equipped with this privilege.\nThird, administrators can manually invoke these requests.\nThis is particularly useful in testing the actions associated with those requests.\nFourth, request forwarded to the AutomatedServlet.\nFifth, automatedServlet uses the AutomatedActionFactory to generate the matching AutomatedAction object, e.g. CompileLogsAction.\nSixth, automatedServlet executes the action.\nSeventh, the corresponding AutomatedAction will be performed, interacting with the Logic component as necessary.\nGAE server sends such automated requests through two different configurations.\nThese configurations are cron jobs or task queue workers.\nCron jobs are jobs that are automatically scheduled for a specified period of time, e.g. scheduling feedback session opening reminders.\nIt is configured in cron.xml.\nTask queue workers are hybrids of user-invoked and GAE-invoked in that they are queued by users (i.e. users request for the tasks to be added to queue), but executed by GAE (i.e. GAE determines when and which tasks in the queue are executed at any point of time).\nThis is typically used for tasks that may take a long time to finish and can exceed the 1 minute standard request processing limit imposed by GAE.\nIt is configured in queue.xml as well as the TaskQueue nested class of the Const class.\nSince the high-level workflow of processing a request is same for any request (differing by the two request types only), we use the Template Method pattern to abstract the process flow into the Action and AutomatedAction classes.\nThe Logic component handles the business logic of TEAMMATES.\nIn particular, it is responsible for the following.\nManaging relationships between entities, e.g. cascade logic for create/update/delete.\nManaging transactions, e.g. ensuring atomicity of a transaction.\nSanitizing input values received from the UI component.\nProviding a mechanism for checking access control rights.\nConnecting to GAE-provided or third-party APIs, e.g. for adding tasks to the task queue and for sending emails with third-party providers.\nPackage overview contains logic.api, logic.core.\nlogic.api provides the API of the component to be accessed by the UI.\nlogic.core contains the core logic of the system.\nLogic API is represented by the classes Logic, GateKeeper, EmailGenerator, EmailSender, TaskQueuer.\nLogic is a Facade class which connects to the several Logic classes to handle the logic related to various types of data and to access data from the Storage component.\nGateKeeper checks access rights of a user for a given action.\nEmailGenerator generates emails to be sent.\nEmailSender sends email with the

In a first step, you shall elaborate on the following documentation:\n\nHigh-level architecture.\nThe following diagram provides a high-level view of how BigBlueButton's components work together.\nWe'll break down each component in more detail below.\n\n\nHTML5 client.\n\nThe HTML5 client is a single page, responsive web application that is built upon the following components:\nReact.js for rendering the user interface in an efficient manner, WebRTC for sending/receiving audio and video.\nThe HTML5 client connects directly with the BigBlueButton server over port 443 (SSL), from loading the BigBlueButton client to making a web socket connection. These connections are all handled by nginx.\nThe HTML5 server sits behind nginx.\nThe HTML5 server is built upon Meteor.js in ECMA2015 for communication between client and server and upon MongoDB for keeping the state of each BigBlueButton client consistent with the BigBlueButton server.\nThe MongoDB database contains information about all meetings on the server and, in turn, each client connected to a meeting.\nEach user's client is only aware of the their meeting's state, such the user's public and private chat messages sent and received. The client side subscribes to the published collections on the server side.\nUpdates to MongoDB on the server side are automatically pushed to MiniMongo on the client side.\nThe following diagram gives an overview of the architecture of the HTML5 client and its communications with the other components in BigBlueButton.\n\n\nScalability of HTML5 server component.\n\nBigBlueButton 2.2 used a single nodejs process for all client-side communication.\nThis process would start to bottleneck (the nodejs process, running on a single CPU core, started to use 100% of the core).\nBecause nodejs was running on a single CPU core, having a 16 or 32 CPU core server for BigBlueButton 2.2 failed to yield much additional scalability.\nBigBlueButton 2.3 moves away from a single nodejs process for bbb-html5 towards multiple nodejs processes handling incoming messages from clients.\nThis means that bbb-html5 could use multiple CPU cores for processing messages and handling browser sessions (each nodejs process runs on a single CPU core).\nAs of 2.3-alpha-7, bbb-html5 uses 2 \"frontend\" and two \"backend\" processes (this value is configurable in bbb-html5-with-roles.conf, see Configuration Files).\nA restart of BigBlueButton is required if you make changes to these files.\nThe breakdown of functionality between front-end and back-end is as follows:\nFrontends receive the ValidateAuthTokenResp event to complete authentication.\nFrontends collection subscription and publishing.\nFrontends other DDP events including method calls to send events to akka-apps\nFrontends handle completely the Streamer redis events: Cursor, Annotations, External video share.\nFrontends still require MeetingStarted and MeetingEnded events to create/destroy per-meeting event processing queues.\nBackends handle all the non-streamer events.\nIf more than one backend is running, bbb-web splits the load in round-robin fashion by assigning an instanceId.\nSo individual backends only process redis events for the meetings matching the associated instanceId.\nValidateAuthTokenResp is passed to backends as well, which is needed for the cases where you only have a backend, no frontends - for example dev environments that do not need to care about scaling.\nWhen you use sudo bbb-conf --setip <hostname> or sudo bbb-conf --restart, bbb-conf will run /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-conf/apply-config.sh between shutdown and restart of the BigBlueButton processes.\nIn this way, you can change configuration values of BigBlueButton, or use some of the helper functions in apply-lib.sh.\nSee \"Automatically apply configuration changes on restart\".\n\n\nBBB web.\n\nBigBlueButton web application is a Java-based application written in Scala.
